That tradition of innovation and quality continues today. From a brand that is synonymous with quality, comfort and style, the Serta Santa Cruz Collection Sofa offers many attractive features that you're going to love. Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required.

From a brand that is synonymous with quality, comfort and style, the Serta Santa Cruz Collection Sofa offers many attractive features that you're going to love. Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required.

Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required.

Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required.

But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density.

That tradition of innovation and quality continues today. From a brand that is synonymous with quality, comfort and style, the Serta Santa Cruz Collection Sofa offers many attractive features that you're going to love. Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required. Designed in the USA.

That tradition of innovation and quality continues today. From a brand that is synonymous with quality, comfort and style, the Serta Santa Cruz Collection Sofa offers many attractive features that you're going to love. Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required.

That tradition of innovation and quality continues today. From a brand that is synonymous with quality, comfort and style, the Serta Santa Cruz Collection Sofa offers many attractive features that you're going to love. Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required.

The stakes: $1 million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see the most cities in North America - in just 7 days. Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure game. Players collect train cards that enable them to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who can fulfill their Destination Tickets by connecting two distant cities, and to the player who builds the longest continuous railway. For 2 to 5 players ages 8 and older. Playing time: 30-60 minutes.

That tradition of innovation and quality continues today. From a brand that is synonymous with quality, comfort and style, the Serta Santa Cruz Collection Sofa offers many attractive features that you're going to love. Starting with its Tool-free EZ assembly, which is the most convenient and stress free on the market today. This product goes from box to built in mere minutes. But that's just the beginning, this sofa is generous and comfortable as well. In fact, you might find it a great place for a nap. Here's why: Starting from the ground up, you have a solid stance on real wood legs. Next, the lower foundation is constructed with hardwood materials and the tried and true method of mechanically fastened and glued hardwood plywood corner blocks that reinforce the frame and sturdiness, along with track style arms with corrugated reinforced outer-sides. Attached to that are heavy-duty 8 gauge anti-sag sinuous springs secured and joined with a double row of tie wire. This forms a comfortable, supportive and lasting seating structure. Resting upon this are seat cushions with rows of individually pocketed comfort coils surrounded by high density seating foam, and premium quality poly-fibers on top. This cushion system forms the basis of our sit down, and sink in feel. Behind that you have the upper structure which consists of more hardwood material and a matrix of non-woven strapping that form a dense and sturdy back structure. In front of that are the pillowed back cushions. These consist of an inner poly-fiber core contained in a non-woven cover to help maintain shape and density. Wrap the whole thing in a lush and luxurious 100-Percent polyester Platinum Fabric and you have a gorgeous piece for any living space. 1 year limited warranty. Product assembly is required.

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

  Parameters: {"name"=>" Blue Ocean Strategy", "description"=>" The global phenomenon, embraced by business worldwide and now published in more than 40 languages.\r\n\r\nThis international bestseller challenges everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success.\r\n\r\nSince the dawn of the industrial age, companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained, profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future.", "image_url"=>"http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg", "article_url"=>"", "content_type"=>"1", "tag"=>"1", "content_id"=>"11"}

Porter's Competitive Strategy has transformed the theory, practice, and teaching of business strategy throughout the world. Electrifying in its simplicity—like all great breakthroughs—Porter’s analysis of industries captures the complexity of industry competition in five underlying forces. Porter introduces one of the most powerful competitive tools yet developed: his three generic strategies—lowest cost, differentiation, and focus—which bring structure to the task of strategic positioning. He shows how competitive advantage can be defined in terms of relative cost and relative prices, thus linking it directly to profitability, and presents a whole new perspective on how profit is created and divided. In the almost two decades since publication, Porter's framework for predicting competitor behavior has transformed the way in which companies look at their rivals and has given rise to the new discipline of competitor assessment. \r\n\r\nMore than a million managers in both large and small companies, investment analysts, consultants, students, and scholars throughout the world have internalized Porter's ideas and applied them to assess industries, understand competitors, and choose competitive positions.

  Parameters: {"name"=>"Blue Ocean Strategy  ", "desc"=>"The global phenomenon, embraced by business worldwide and now published in more than 40 languages.\r\n\r\nThis international bestseller challenges everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success.\r\n\r\nSince the dawn of the industrial age, companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained, profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future.", "image_url"=>"http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg", "article_url"=>"", "content_type"=>"1", "tag"=>"1", "content_id"=>"11"}

Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:24:09 UTC +00:00]]

Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

The journey to becoming a values-based leader starts with self-reflection. He asks, \"If you are not self-reflective, how can you know yourself? If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself? If you cannot lead yourself, how can you lead others?\" Kraemer identifies self-reflection as the first of four principles that guide leaders to make choices that honor their values and candidly recounts how these principles helped him navigate some of the toughest challenges he faced in his career.\r\n\r\nOffers a framework for adopting the principles of values-based leadership—self-reflection, balance, true self-confidence, and genuine humility—to lead organizations effectively\r\nBased on Kraemer's popular Kellogg MBA course on values-based leadership\r\nA recognized expert in values-based leadership, Kraemer is a sought after speaker on the subject\r\nLively and engaging, Kraemer's book comes at a critical time when true leadership in every facet of society is desperately needed.\r\n"], ["image_url", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ew1OwyjfL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"], ["name", "From Values to Action: The Four Principles of Values-Based Leadership "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Values-Action-Principles-Values-Based-Leadership-ebook/dp/B004SHOHT6"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:29:23 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself?

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself?

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

The journey to becoming a values-based leader starts with self-reflection. He asks, \"If you are not self-reflective, how can you know yourself? If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself? If you cannot lead yourself, how can you lead others?\" Kraemer identifies self-reflection as the first of four principles that guide leaders to make choices that honor their values and candidly recounts how these principles helped him navigate some of the toughest challenges he faced in his career.\r\n\r\nOffers a framework for adopting the principles of values-based leadership—self-reflection, balance, true self-confidence, and genuine humility—to lead organizations effectively\r\nBased on Kraemer's popular Kellogg MBA course on values-based leadership\r\nA recognized expert in values-based leadership, Kraemer is a sought after speaker on the subject\r\nLively and engaging, Kraemer's book comes at a critical time when true leadership in every facet of society is desperately needed.\r\n"], ["image_url", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ew1OwyjfL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"], ["name", "From Values to Action: The Four Principles of Values-Based Leadership "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Values-Action-Principles-Values-Based-Leadership-ebook/dp/B004SHOHT6"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:32:31 UTC +00:00]]

Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:32:45 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:33:05 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:33:23 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:33:35 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:33:47 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:33:54 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

The journey to becoming a values-based leader starts with self-reflection. He asks, \"If you are not self-reflective, how can you know yourself? If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself? If you cannot lead yourself, how can you lead others?\" Kraemer identifies self-reflection as the first of four principles that guide leaders to make choices that honor their values and candidly recounts how these principles helped him navigate some of the toughest challenges he faced in his career.\r\n\r\nOffers a framework for adopting the principles of values-based leadership—self-reflection, balance, true self-confidence, and genuine humility—to lead organizations effectively\r\nBased on Kraemer's popular Kellogg MBA course on values-based leadership\r\nA recognized expert in values-based leadership, Kraemer is a sought after speaker on the subject\r\nLively and engaging, Kraemer's book comes at a critical time when true leadership in every facet of society is desperately needed.\r\n"], ["image_url", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ew1OwyjfL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"], ["name", "From Values to Action: The Four Principles of Values-Based Leadership "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Values-Action-Principles-Values-Based-Leadership-ebook/dp/B004SHOHT6"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:34:07 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:34:15 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:34:26 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:34:34 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:34:44 UTC +00:00]]

If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself?

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.

They develop the central concepts of modern finance: arbitrage, net present value, efficient markets, agency theory, options, and the trade-off between risk and return, and use them to explain corporate finance with a balance of theory and application. The Tenth Edition includes many exciting new research findings as well as an enhanced Connect Finance, now with even more student learning resources."], ["image_url", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fhQvMZ4VL._SY300_.jpg"], ["name", "Corporate Finance "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Finance-Mcgraw-Hill-Series-Insurance/dp/0078034779/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:35:31 UTC +00:00]]

The journey to becoming a values-based leader starts with self-reflection. He asks, \"If you are not self-reflective, how can you know yourself? If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself? If you cannot lead yourself, how can you lead others?\" Kraemer identifies self-reflection as the first of four principles that guide leaders to make choices that honor their values and candidly recounts how these principles helped him navigate some of the toughest challenges he faced in his career.\r\n\r\nOffers a framework for adopting the principles of values-based leadership—self-reflection, balance, true self-confidence, and genuine humility—to lead organizations effectively\r\nBased on Kraemer's popular Kellogg MBA course on values-based leadership\r\nA recognized expert in values-based leadership, Kraemer is a sought after speaker on the subject\r\nLively and engaging, Kraemer's book comes at a critical time when true leadership in every facet of society is desperately needed.\r\n"], ["image_url", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ew1OwyjfL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"], ["name", "From Values to Action: The Four Principles of Values-Based Leadership "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Values-Action-Principles-Values-Based-Leadership-ebook/dp/B004SHOHT6"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:35:31 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:35:39 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:36:46 UTC +00:00]]

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 02:48:35 UTC +00:00]]

If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself?

The authors aim to present corporate finance as the working of a small number of integrated and powerful intuitions, rather than a collection of unrelated topics. They develop the central concepts of modern finance: arbitrage, net present value, efficient markets, agency theory, options, and the trade-off between risk and return, and use them to explain corporate finance with a balance of theory and application.

  Parameters: {"name"=>"Blue Ocean Strategy  ", "desc"=>"The global phenomenon, embraced by business worldwide and now published in more than 40 languages.\r\n\r\nThis international bestseller challenges everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success.\r\n\r\nSince the dawn of the industrial age, companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained, profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future.", "image_url"=>"http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg", "article_url"=>"", "content_type"=>"1", "tag"=>"7", "content_id"=>"12"}

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 03:12:55 UTC +00:00]]

They develop the central concepts of modern finance: arbitrage, net present value, efficient markets, agency theory, options, and the trade-off between risk and return, and use them to explain corporate finance with a balance of theory and application.

  Parameters: {"name"=>"Blue Ocean Strategy  ", "desc"=>"The global phenomenon, embraced by business worldwide and now published in more than 40 languages.\r\n\r\nThis international bestseller challenges everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success.\r\n\r\nSince the dawn of the industrial age, companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained, profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool.

They develop the central concepts of modern finance: arbitrage, net present value, efficient markets, agency theory, options, and the trade-off between risk and return, and use them to explain corporate finance with a balance of theory and application.

Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W.

They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future."], ["image_url", "http://rdemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/blue-ocean.jpg"], ["name", "Blue Ocean Strategy  "], ["source_url", "http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition-ebook/dp/B004OC07F8/"], ["updated_at", Mon, 17 Mar 2014 03:25:10 UTC +00:00]]
